# ICB_EX8
Files for exercise 8
Part 1 is in: Ex08Portmann1.py
Part 2 is in: Ex08Portmann2.py

The Ex08Portmann.py has a bit of both of the exercises, however should not be used for grading because it had some errors
and I thought it would be easier to split it up. But I left it up on github so the progression of my work can be seen.
